--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test1.dft

A simple DFT consisting of a 2/3 voting gate and 3 exponentially distributed
basic events.

Example usage: coral -f test1.dft -t 1.0 2.0 3.0
Computes the unreliabilities for timepoints 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 and writes them
to standard output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test2.dft

A simple non-deterministic DFT.

Example usage: coral -f test2.dft -t 1.0 2.0 3.0
Computes the maximal* unreliabilities for timepoints 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 and
writes them to standard output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test3.dft

A simple DFT consisting of a 2/3 voting gate, 2 exponentially distributed
basic events and one PH-distributed basic event. Note: uses file erl2_2.bcg.

Example usage: coral -f test3.dft -t 1.0 2.0 3.0
Computes the unreliabilities for timepoints 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 and writes them
to standard output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test_all.dft

A simple DFT which uses all DFT features. Note: uses file erl2_2.bcg.

Example usage: coral -f test_all.dft -t 1.0 2.0 3.0
Computes the maximal* unreliabilities for timepoints 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 and
writes them to standard output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ftpp4.dft

A DFT from a case study modeling a fault-tolerant parallel processor system.

Example usage: coral -f ftpp4.dft -i 100 10000 100 -O example.csv
Computes the unreliabilities for timepoints 100 to 10000 in steps of 100
time-units and writes the results to a comma-separated file example.csv.
This file can be used to generate a plot using gnuplot. A sample gnuplot
script is provided in the file example_plot.gp.
Example usage: gnuplot example_plot.gp
The resulting figure can be found in the file example_plot.ps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reuse.dft

A DFT which reuses the "test1.dft" model. The DFT consists of an AND-gate with
2 inputs which are 2 copies of the "test1.dft" model. To succesfully analyze
this system the composed I/O-IMC for "test1.dft" has to be generated first.

Example usage:
coral -f test1.dft -C test1 -a
coral -f reuse.dft -t 1.0 2.0 3.0

Constructs first the composed model for "test1.dft" and uses it to compute
the unreliabities of "reuse.dft" for timepoints 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test1_err.dft

Example of a DFT-file with a syntax error.

Example usage: coral -f test3.dft -t 1.0 2.0 3.0
An error message should be generated.

*Maximal for all untimed schedulers on the globally-uniformized CTMDP.
